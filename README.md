### Hello!### Hello!
I'm Arc, a tech hobbyist, primarily focused on programming and (appropriately implemented) AI. I've dabbled in more or less everything, from databases and VMs to neural networks. 
Currently, I am focused on generative AI, in particular LLMs, with a side focus on image generation.  
If you want to contact me for any particular purpose, you can reach me through @Arctursus on [Discord](https://www.discord.com).  
I am also technically available on Twitter/X and Bluesky, but without any guarantees that I'll get back to you anytime soon.

Personal git host at https://git.arcsnet.dev
