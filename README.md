### Hello!
I'm Arc, a tech hobbyist, primarily focused on programming. I've dabbled in more or less everything, from databases and VMs to neural networks.
My skills are limited, but consistently expanding as I delve into more projects and learn new things for them. I am most experienced in modding games.
Currently, I am focused on generative AI, in particular LLMs, with a side focus on image generation.
If you want to contact me for any particular purpose, you can reach me through @Arctursus on Discord.
